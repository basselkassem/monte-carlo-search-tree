# Monte Carlo tree search algorithm

Monte Carlo tree search is an algorithm that combines reinforcement learning and tree search concepts to solve problems difficult or impossible to solve using other approaches. MCTS was introduced in 2006 for computer Go. It has been used in other board games like chess and shogi. 
MCTS's main purpose is to answer the question: Given a game's state, what is the most promising move to make next?
